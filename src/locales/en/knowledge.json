Special attention will be paid to the differences between these models, examining the principles that underpin them and the conflicts that emerge from these divergences. The focus is on identifying the silences that have resulted from the predominance of certain definitions of philanthropy, what its objectives are and what its responsibilities are, to the detriment of other approaches. The goal is to illuminate how these choices shape philanthropic practices in the country, highlighting the impacts of historical and conceptual exclusions on the development of the sector."

Despite the importance of the topic, there are few academic studies, particularly in the field of philosophy and political theory, which approach philanthropy in a critical and in-depth manner. While there is some literature on the historical evolution, scope and emergence of philanthropy, especially in the United States and parts of Europe, little has been produced on the formulation of a model of philanthropy suitable for countries in the Global South. The development of such a model requires a normative and historical movement that positions Brazilian philanthropy in the context of survival - that is, in the continuity of slavery, colonialism and their persistent forms of oppression, inequalities and unjustifiable hierarchies."

The expected impact is the creation of an environment rich in exchanges of knowledge and substantial analysis, promoting the valorization of theoretical and practical training in the field of philanthropy. The seminars and the results obtained will be widely disseminated and shared, contributing to the construction of a new philanthropic political theory in Brazil - which could even influence global practices, from the perspective of the Global South."
